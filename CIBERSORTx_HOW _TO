How to prepare files for CIBERSORTx

1) If you have clusters/cell types from the analysis of scRNA-seq and the marker genes that define
   those clusters, then this is the "Signature Matrix" file. Otherwise create the Signature Matrix.
   
                   cluster_1  cluster_2 ... cluster_k
   marker gene 1   exp        exp           exp
   marker gene 2
   ...
   marker gene n
   
2) Prepare mixture file with bulk RNA-seq expressions

            sample_1  sample_2 ... sample_k
   gene 1   exp       exp          exp
   gene 2
   ...
   gene all
   
3) Run "Impute Cell Fractions" on CIBERSORTx website. 

a) Use raw counts in both scRNA and RNA-seq data. 
b) Run Batch correction with S-mode. For that you need a "Reference File" with the gene expression 
   of each cell (assigned to a cluster/cell type) and each gene. 
   
                   cell in cluster_1  cell in cluster_2 ... cell in cluster_k
   marker gene 1   exp                exp                   exp
   marker gene 2
   ...
   marker gene all
